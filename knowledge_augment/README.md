**Docker** should be turned on before enabling the service.

The first time you use it, you should download docker-compose first
and run **docker-compose up -d** in the same directory.
Subsequently, the database is created with the corresponding code in **create_milvus.py**.

Run **create_milvusDB.py, insert_db.py**, and input **streamlit run app.py** in cmd to get access to the USTC-GPT interface.

*create_milvusDB.py* generates a vector database in milvus, which is stored in the format of 'ID, embedding, text'.

*extract_embedding* serves to obtain the embedding vector generated by the corresponding extraction (We use the embedding model bge-large-zh here, whose download address is https://huggingface.co/BAAI).

*judgement.py* serves to the search in the vector database, and the content/abstract of the data is retrieved with the questions in the QA data, then the rank of the correct answer is output to judge the search effect.

*app.py* serves to generate the USTC-GPT interface.
